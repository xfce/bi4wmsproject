Updateï¼š I have designed a new single board for this, and all test OK

See wiki for details

================================================

For latest version, go to http://hacks.esar.org.uk/

How to use:

1) Manufacture the HDMI receiver board that can be found in 
   the 'board' directory (CADSoft Eagle format).
2) Open the 'fpga/hdmilight.xise' project in Xilinx ISE and
   generate a bit file.
3) Edit the files under the config directory to configure
   the LEDs.
4) Edit 'Makefile' in the top level directory and set
   the DATA2MEM path for the Xilinx data2mem tool location
   on your system.
5) Run 'make' in the top level directory, which will build
   'tools/makemem', then the firmware image, then the config
   files, before merging the firmware and config into the
   final bitfile.
   The final result should be hdmilight.bit in the top
   level directory.
6) Upload hdmilight.bit to a Papilio Pro FPGA board
7) Install the HDMI receiver board on to the Papilio board.
8) Connect LED strips to output pins
9) Open a serial terminal to the Papilio
10) Connect HDMI source to receiver board
11) It should now be working.
